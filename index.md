The purpose of this course is to provide students the opportunity to continue the learning began in the [Software Carpentry bootcamp](https://iglpdc.github.com/2014-01-13-uri) that was held January 13-15.  In this course, students will be exposed to new R programming concepts and R applications.  The first few class periods will be devoted to teaching some basics of reproducibility with R through the development of blog posts with R markdown and discussion of a few additional R applications and packages.  The remainder of the class will be student led presentations (based off of the blog posts).  Additionally, a final project (a poster), will be presented at a poster session during finals that discusses how the students have uses R within their own research.
